# PrusaSlicer AppData Sync

## Description

These two simple batch scripts help update/sync PrusaSlicer's configuration files from a master source. It's faster than exporting and importing a config file, and includes system presets as well as user ones. 

The main script (`Update_PrusaSlicer_config.bat`) pulls the configuration files from a GitHub repository and replaces the contents of PrusaSlicer's AppData folder. By default, it doesn't replace the `snapshots` folder.

The second script (`Push_current_config.bat`), is just a shortcut to push any new configuration changes to the main repository.

This is currently used in a school's makerspace to ensure all the computers have the right configuration and options for the students to use our 3D printers. The script runs automatically on login on every computer.

## Installation

### 1. Install Git
In order to run these scripts, Git must be installed on your computer. You can download it here: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### 2. Set up a GitHub repository
You need a GitHub repository to upload your configuration.

### 3. Gitignore
Before running the Push script for the first time, it might be a good idea to set up a `.gitignore` file and put it in PrusaSlicer's AppData folder (a quick way to find it is to hit Win+R and type `%appdata%\prusaslicer`). If you don't have one, the script will make a simple one:
```
*.bak
/snapshots
PrusaSlicerGcodeViewer*
```
This will avoid uploading any backups, or any GcodeViewer files.

You might want to exclude more files, for efficiency and to remove overhead. For example, my `.gitignore` file looks like this:

```
*.bak
/snapshots
/physical_printer
/shapes
/sla_material
/sla_print
PrusaSlicerGcodeViewer*
```
### 4. Change the user variables
Make sure to set `repoauthor` and `reponame` to your own github usename and repository, or whoever's you might be using for the configuration. You can open the .bat file with any text editor to do that.

```bat
set repoauthor=YOUR GITHUB USERNAME
set reponame=YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY NAME
```

## Usage

After having set up a repository and changed the user variables in the script, open PrusaSlicer and choose the presets that you want to have appear as default, then close it.

Run the `Push_current_config.bat` by double-clicking it. A security prompt might prevent you from running it, but you can bypass it by clicking "More Info".

Run `Update_PrusaSlicer_config.bat` on the computers you want to sync the settings to (the same security prompt will appear the first time you run it). Make sure PrusaSlicer is not running when you run the script.

You can automate the process by running the Update script on login.

## Limitations

- This process transfers ALL PrusaSlicer settings, not only printer configurations. It also transfers things that don't make sense, like recently opened files, or default save file locations with broken filepaths.
- Batch files only work on Windows. I've attempted writing up a shell script to be used on Mac, but couldn't test it properly. If you're on Linux, you could probably modify that one to make it work for you, just change the path to PrusaSlicer's config files.
